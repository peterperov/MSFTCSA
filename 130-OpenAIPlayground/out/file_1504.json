Spurs had also made an undisclosed offer for 21-year-old defender Dawson. Forest chief executive Mark Arthur said: \"We've received an \u00c2\u00a38m bid from Spurs for the two players and we're considering the offer.\" Southampton's offer for Republic of Ireland international Reid comprised \u00c2\u00a33m-plus and two players - Brett Ormerod and Darren Kenton.
