Make sure you login as your admin account, as only admin has access to the billing data.

Click on Usage
Download -> CSV Download (hidden)

Start PowerBI Desktop 

Get Data -> Excel 
IMPORTANT ->  File Origin Dropdown ->  US-ASCII

Data page 
	Select Date Column, set Data Type as Date, You can change Date Format

Details Report
	Add Slicer, Field -> date, Top level dropdown -> Between 

	Add Stacked Column Chart
		X Axist -> Date (Untick Date Hierarchy)
		Y Axis -> Cost

	Add Table (left side)
		Add Date, Service Name, Cost 

	Add Table (right side)
		Add Service Name, Region, ServiceType, Cost, Quantity 

You can rename the fields by clicking Columns -> Column -> Rename for this visual

Now you have nice Report and let's rename it to "Details". 
You can use slicer to narrow the date range and then drill through cost break down for more details.

File Source
	PowerBI loads all the data from the original source into a little database engine inside PowerBI. 

Advanced Stuff

File Source: 
	Transform Data -> Queries -> First step is usually the source, where you can find name of the file 



So now let's make it a bit more fun. 

In PowerBI you can use OneDrive (or sharepoint) as the data source. So in order to simplify the process of reloading the file let's do just that. 

Let's go back to our website and download the consumption .csv again 
This time we gonna copy it to the Sharepoint location, and check that it actually appears on the Sharepoint 

https://captainazure.sharepoint.com/sites/AzureCostLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx

Let's copy paste the documents url we will need it later

https://captainazure.sharepoint.com/sites/AzureCostLibrary/Shared%20Documents


Then let's go back to our PowerBI report and make some changes

Get Data -> Sharepoint Folder, (link without Shared Documents)

https://captainazure.sharepoint.com/sites/AzureCostLibrary/


Text Filter Begins With AzureUsage
= Table.SelectRows(Source, each Text.StartsWith([Name], "AzureUsage"))

"Date Modified" -> Date Time Filters is Latest

In the File Origin Dropdown select: "20127: US-ASCII" !!!!

Now a little trick = you can just change the source of AzureUsage to "SharepointDocs" and remove the extra steps

Now, we will still gonna have to change the date parsing from US format to EU format

Back to TransformData
Date -> Split Column, By Delimeter "/", 

"Add Column" -> Merge Columns -> Name: "Date", Separator "/"


For the decimal separator you may need to add a similar transformation. 


Now, let's upload it to PowerBI Service

login to 
https://app.powerbi.com/home

And create a new workspace

Back to Desktop, File-> Save, File Publish, pick created workspace
Back to PowerBI workspace you can see that it created Report and a DataSet.

In the DataSet Settings -> Data Source Credentials -> Edit Credentials: OAuth2 and Ogranisational

You can also set daily refresh of the dataset, but I normally just manually click on refresh button.
